            <p>Hello there! My name is Dave Anderson and welcome to my portfolio page.
                I graduated from the University of Washington with a Bachelor's of Science in Electrical
                Engineering. I have worke in the semiconductor industry with Cypress Semiconductor for the last year as an 
                Electrical Design Engineer, focusing on Analog IC design. Recently, however, I feel drawn to the possiblities of innovation
                in software and web development. I also have a strong interest in learning more about deep learning, neural networks and artificial intelligence.
                This displays several of my strongest projects showcasing my skills. I also enjoy hiking, climbing, cooking, playing guitar, 
                piano, bass, drums and singing. My secret passion is to become a indie rockstar.
